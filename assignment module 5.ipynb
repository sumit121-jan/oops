        "\n",
        "A **class method** operates on the class itself rather than on its instances. It is defined using the `@classmethod` decorator, and its first parameter is conventionally named `cls`, representing the class. Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes, making them ideal for operations that affect the class as a whole. For example, a class method can be used to track the number of objects created or implement factory methods that instantiate objects in specialized ways. Unlike instance methods, class methods cannot directly access instance-specific attributes unless explicitly passed as arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a **static method** belongs to the class but does not operate on an instance or the class itself. It is defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and does not take `self` or `cls` as a parameter. Static methods are utility or helper functions that do not depend on class or instance data. They can be called on the class or its instances and are particularly useful for tasks like mathematical operations, data validation, or general-purpose logic that fits naturally within the class context but does not rely on its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary distinction between these two lies in their scope and purpose. A class method is tightly coupled with the class and can modify or access its state, while a static method is entirely independent of the class or its instances. For instance, in a class representing cars, a class method might return the total number of cars manufactured, whereas a static method could calculate the fuel efficiency of a car given certain parameters.\n",

Class methods are often used for operations that require a reference to the class, such as altering shared data or creating alternative constructors. Static methods are employed for tasks that enhance the functionality of the class without requiring access to its attributes or behavior."

These variables are typically accessed through the class name but can also be accessed through an instance. On the other hand, **instance variables** are unique to each object created from the class and are defined within the `__init__()` method using `self`. These variables store data specific to each instance, so changing an instance variable in one object does not affect others.

        "The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent class, allowing for the inheritance of functionality in a subclass. Its primary significance is in facilitating method resolution order (MRO) and enabling multi-level inheritance. By using super(), a subclass can access methods from its parent class (or grandparent class, etc.), without directly referring to the parent class by name. This is especially useful in complex inheritance hierarchies or when working with multiple inheritance, as it ensures that the method from the most appropriate class in the hierarchy is called, based on the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "The super() function is typically used within the subclass’s methods, often in the __init__ method, to invoke the parent class's initialization or other methods. This helps avoid redundancy and promotes code reuse. Additionally, in multiple inheritance scenarios, super() ensures that each class in the inheritance chain is called properly, following the MRO, which is critical for avoiding issues like method conflicts."

        "The __del__ method in Python is a special method, also known as a destructor, that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. Its primary significance lies in allowing an object to clean up resources, such as closing files, releasing network connections, or deallocating other system resources, before it is removed from memory. The __del__ method can be used to define custom cleanup behavior for objects that need it, ensuring that resources are properly released to avoid memory leaks or other issues related to resource management.\n",

        "However, it's important to note that the timing of the __del__ method’s invocation is not guaranteed. The method is invoked when Python’s garbage collector determines that an object is no longer in use, but this can depend on the internal workings of the Python memory management system. The __del__ method should be used carefully, as relying on it for critical cleanup tasks might lead to issues, particularly if circular references exist or if the Python interpreter's garbage collector is delayed."

A `@staticmethod` is a method that does not require access to either the class (`cls`) or the instance (`self`). It behaves like a regular function that belongs to the class's namespace and is used for operations that don't need knowledge of the class or instance's state. It can be called on the class itself or on an instance. On the other hand, a `@classmethod` takes the class (`cls`) as its first argument and is used to operate on the class itself rather than on individual instances. It can access and modify class-level attributes but does not have access to instance-specific data unless explicitly passed an instance. While `@staticmethod` is typically used for utility functions related to the class, `@classmethod` is used when there's a need to modify or access class-level data."

        "Polymorphism in Python, particularly when combined with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, but each class can have its own implementation of methods. The key idea behind polymorphism is that a single interface (such as a method) can be used to represent different behaviors, depending on the object’s actual class. This is made possible through method overriding in subclasses, where a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in the parent class but implements a different behavior.\n",
        "\n",

The `speak()` method behaves differently depending on whether it's called on a `Dog` or a `Cat` object. Even though both `Dog` and `Cat` are instances of the superclass `Animal`, they respond differently to the same method call. This is polymorphism in action—specifically **method overriding**, which allows different subclasses to define their own behavior for a method that exists in the parent class.\n",
